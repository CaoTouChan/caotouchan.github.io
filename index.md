As a data scientist with over 5 years of experience, I have developed and deployed data-driven solutions for various business problems, from destination recommendation to price optimization. I have a strong background in machine learning and data analysis, as well as a master's degree in Fintech and Investment Management.

In my most recent role at Meituan, I designed and built ML models to solve challenges in the map service domains, and automated ML pipelines using cloud and MLOps tools. I improved the accuracy and performance of several key models, such as the destination recommendation model, the price model, and the few-shot learning model. I also collaborated with project managers and data scientists to ensure the long-term success of the models. I am passionate about applying machine learning to create value and impact for customers and businesses.
